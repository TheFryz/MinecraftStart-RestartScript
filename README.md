# MinecraftStart-RestartScript

A custom restart script, to make it work right click and edit "Start.bat" and replace the jar file with your own server jar.
Then run your server until it is online. When done, stop and edit "spigot.yml". Find "restart-script", and copy and replace with this "restart-script: restart.bat"
Done
